# XAI-Text-Sentiment-Classification

This project entails the application of two **local model-agnostic methods (LIME and SHAP)**, within the domain of **eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**, for the task of text sentiment classification. It involved the development of three different modelsof increasing complexity, ranging from a traditional machine learning techniqueto more advanced architectures: Support Vector Machine (SVM), LongShort-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network and a pre-trainedTransformer-based model (RoBERTa). These models were trained (or fine-tunedin the case of RoBERTa) on a subset of theAmazon Review dataset to perform text classification, specifically focusing onsentiment analysis. The dataset contains software reviews and their associated ratings,making it suitable for sentiment analysis tasks that classify reviews as positive,negative or neutral based on textual content. Subsequently, specific review instanceswere explained based on the predictions generated by these modelsusing LIME and SHAP.
